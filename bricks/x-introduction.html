    <h1>Welcome to the TCI</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>On this page you will find statements people might use to describe their attitudes, opinions, interests, and other personal feelings. For each of the following questions, please select the response that best describes the way you usually or generally act or feel. (Select only one response for each question.)</p>

    <p>There are five possible responses for each question:<p>
    <ol>
      <li>Definitely False</li>
      <li>Mostly or Probably False</li>
      <li>Neither True nor False, or About Equally True or False</li>
      <li>Mostly or Probably True</li>
      <li>Definitely True</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Read each statement carefully, but don’t spend too much time deciding on the answer. Most people can finish this test in a bit less than an hour. Please answer every statement, even if you are not completely sure of the answer. Try to describe yourself the way you usually or generally act and feel, not just how you are feeling right now. Remember there are no right or wrong answers — just describe your own personal opinions and feelings.</p>
